		<h1>Hello...</h1>
		<h3>To Whoever is looking at this page,</h3>
		<p>
			Thank you, for coming to my portfolio site and coming to my Resume page. I do not expect many people to come to this page as this site is not really much. It is really just a portfolio page. I made this website to get back to web development a bit and to learn more coding langauges. Currently as of March 14th, 2017, I have built this site from scratch, using purely HTMl & CSS. Nothing special really. But this is subject to change at any moment. Currently, I am spending my free time working on my website, side projects with professors at school, looking for interships, handling school work, and doing a college work study program.
