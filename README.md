## My project site done while learning HTML, CSS, .JS, and jQuery.

### A simple site made to showcase my work.

This is a really simple website that is created using HTML & CSS. I am looking to add Javasctip and jQuery into my site to bring a better look, flow and use for the website. 

Currently I am using to provide several links to my other works and to include a downloadable resume for recruiters.

Don't worry, I did not include the blank webpage or Not Found Error 404 as part of the stages!
